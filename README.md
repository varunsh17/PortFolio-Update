MY PORTFOLIO WEBSITE -- https://varun-sharma.herokuapp.com/

Whenever I open my portfolio I want to first show the landing page (i.e. the computer page sliding up) , but it is not showing if you open website for the first time ..
after then it works fine .. AND also the sliding up effect is not smooth I have used GSAP
